#What happens when classes overlap? How does that affect performance? Which transformations to the feature space work best?

This is a research question within the framework of the Statistics Foundations of Machine Learning course that I took at VUB, as an exchange student in Brussels.


to answer this question, we will follow the plan below:

  1. What is class overlap?
  
  2. What is feature space transformation in Data Science?
  
  3. How does class overlap influence the performance of a classification model?
  
  3. Which transformations to the feature space work best?
  
  4. Comparison of the four transformations over diffrent types of datasets
  What is the dimension of Z space that works better?
  Conclusion
